### Explanation of Where the App is doing create, read, update, insert, delete and drop
---

- **Create** 
   1. Create new type of cuisine, for example "America", "England".  
   -Create a new table by getting table name from input of user. 
   
   This step is creating a new table in our database.

   2. Read `Menu`, `Price`, `Ingredients` by customer from one table.
